# (Modified) Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## MODIFICATION

In my years of experience in business, I have rarely witnessed or have been
a part of 'harassment' of individuals.  While I agree that intentional long
term 'attacks or jokes' about any individual is not approved, our(my) current
mood is that policing of minor situations has gone far overboard. You do not
ruin anybody's career or gather a mob to attack someone who had a bad day
and told a bad joke, or commented on a pretty dress.  Further, there is a
learning curve for young individuals who grow up watching successful comedians
on their off-takes on our society's characteristics.  Young people might not
understand that while these comedians are successful, their jokes have an
appropriate time and place.  Young people can learn this without attempting
to destroy them with a mob just because one person was offended.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## MODIFICATION

Agree with all above, except 'advances of any kind'.  A normal healthy society
is one in which heterosexual males pursue heterosexual females, in various
ways, for the purpose of creating a long-term relationship based on love and
understanding, and possibly procreation - which continues said society.  In
the initial stages of these long-term relationships, there may be awkward
'advances' by said heterosexual male toward the female.  There may be language
that is complimentary.  If the female is agreeable, this language may increase
to be considered inuendo, and even bordering on sexual attention.  This is
normal behavior.  It should not be considered threatening, or odd behavior.
It is not to be used as a crutch to destroy someone.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## MODIFICATION

I do not agree with any course of action by 'Community leaders' or others against
any individual without the Right of DUE PROCESS.  If there is a charge against
a person, he has the right to defend himself against an accuser, and even the
right to face the accuser.  With anonymous charges and no due process, you will
have a breakdown of a society due to injustice.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
elpasojeff@gmail.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## MODIFICATION

Disagree with the last statement.  If a 'community leader' is on a course of
action that may proscribe or 'cancel' a person, all avenues for due process
of the person, including identifying a so called 'victim' should be allowed.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## MODIFICATION

A 'ban' of any individual, that removes their right of creativity, should
only be pursued with options for the individual to find outlets elsewhere.
If there is only one environment for the individuals certain creativity and
you remove that, then there is a right lost.  Again leading to breakdown
of society.
